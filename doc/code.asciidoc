== Code Overview

This section describes all the files in the repository and what their purpose are:

=== Root

.`rebar.config`

The rebar3 configuration file. It contains information about the immediate system dependencies of the project. It also contains information for `relx` the release builder rebar3 uses. This is used to assemble a release by copying the Erlang runtime as well as the necessary support libraries into a release directory. This directory can then be archived via tar(1) or zip(1) and shipped for a production release.

.`Makefile`

Contains some convenience targets when building the software. In practice you have some support-calls that has to be made outside the build tool in many cases. This Makefile contains recipes for doing that, so you don't forget what is to be done.

.`README.md`

Instructions for the reader on Github. Also instructions on how to build the documentation and where to go next.

.`rebar.lock`

Dependency locking for reproducible builds. It makes sure you get versions of packages which are known to be working together and that upgrades of software is a deliberate action rather than an implicit one.

.`apps/*`

The applications provided by this repository. See the following sections for their description.
