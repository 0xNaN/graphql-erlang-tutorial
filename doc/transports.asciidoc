== Transports

GraphQL is a transport-agnostic system. It can be used on top of every
transport you can imagine. This means the GraphQL system must provide
its own way to tell the outside world about errors, since it cannot
rely on the surrounding system to do so.

The interface to GraphQL at its very base needs support for sending
requests and recieving replies. There is relatively little need for
out-of-order requests since queries tend to be large and
all-encompassing.

However, newer parts of GraphQL which is currently being tried out has
support for delayed and streamed responses.footnote:[Through the use
of the `@streamed` and `@defer` directives among other things] Because
of this, GraphQL will need a more powerful transport for those kinds
of features.

.Current state
****
The current {project} implementation does not yet support the optional
tags such as `@streamed` and `@defer`. It is planned for a later
version when the basics are down and works in a robust way.

This tutorial implements GraphQL on top of HTTP through the use of the
Cowboy web server by Lo√Øc Hoguin. We currently use cowboy version
{cowboy-version}.

=== Cowboy Handler

To make GraphQL work with Cowboy, we use the application `sw_web`.
This application then uses `sw_core` in order to run the system. One
could imagine adding other applications to the system if you need more
transports. The web application needs a dispatcher in order to run:
