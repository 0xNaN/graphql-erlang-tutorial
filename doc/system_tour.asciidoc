== System Tour

Since a system as large as GraphQL can seem incomprehensible when you
first use it, we will begin by providing a system tour explaining by
example how the system works. In order to start the system for the
first time, we must construct a _release_.

.Releases
****
Erlang uses a concept called _releases_ for real applications. A
release consists of:

* An erlang emulator for the virtual machine, BEAM as a binary in the
  operating system.
* The set of applications which is configured to be inside the
  release.
* Every dependent application needed by the release-configuration.
* Support libraries for executing the emulator, binary NIF shared
  objects (NIF: Natively implemented function), and so on.
* Configuration for the system and runtime

A release is a self-contained Erlang system living in its own
directory structure. It can be copied to a target machine and started
without having to install any support libraries, as long as the system
architecture is the same. If you provide an appropriate BEAM emulator
for the given architecture, the code will run with little to no
modification as well since the Erlang byte code is highly portable. It
even works across Erlang/OTP versions (subject to some restrictions).
****

To make a release, run the following command:

[source]
----
$ make release
----

This builds a release inside the `_build` directory and makes it
available. In order to run the release, we can ask to run it with a
console frontend, so we get a shell on the Erlang system:

[source]
----
$ _build/default/rel/sw/bin/sw console
----

The system should boot and start running. A typical invocation looks
like:

[source]
----
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:30] [hipe] [kernel-poll:true] [dtrace]

15:33:05.705 [info] Application lager started on node 'sw@127.0.0.1'
15:33:05.705 [info] Application ranch started on node 'sw@127.0.0.1'
15:33:05.706 [info] Application graphql started on node 'sw@127.0.0.1'
15:33:05.706 [info] Application sw_core started on node 'sw@127.0.0.1'
15:33:05.706 [info] Application cowboy started on node 'sw@127.0.0.1'
15:33:05.706 [info] Starting HTTP listener on port 17290
Eshell V8.3  (abort with ^G)
(sw@127.0.0.1)1>
----

TIP: To exit an Erlang node like this, you can either Ctrl-C twice
which stops the system abruptly. Or you can be nice to the system and
ask it to close gracefully one application at a time by entering
`q().<RET>` in the shell.

One the Erlang emulator is running our `sw` release, we can point a
browser to http://localhost:{port-number}/ and you should be greeted
with the following screen:

=== First query

The first query we will run requests a given *Planet* from the system.
In accordance with the rules of Relay Modern GraphQL conventions, we
will load this *Planet* via the _Object Identification_ conventions:

[source,graphql]
----
query PlanetQuery {
  node(id:"UGxhbmV0OjE=") { # <1>
    ... on Planet { # <2>
      id # <3>
      name
      climate
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The *ID* entered here is opaque to the client, and we assume it
    was obtained in an earlier query. We will show typical ways to
    list things later in this section.
<2> This notation, if you are only slightly familiar with GraphQL is
    called an _inline fragment_. The output of the `node` field is of
    type *Node* and here we restrict ourselves to the type *Planet*.
<3> This requests the given fields in the particular starship we loaded.

If you enter this in the GraphiQL left window and press the "`Run`"
button, you should get the following response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "node": {
      "climate": "arid",
      "id": "cGxhbmV0OjE=",
      "name": "Tatooine"
    }
  }
}
----

Note how the response reflects the structure of the query. This is a
powerful feature of GraphQL since it allows you to build up queries
client side and get deterministic results based off of your
query-structure.

=== More advanced queries

TBD
