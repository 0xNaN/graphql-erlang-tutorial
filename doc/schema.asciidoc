== GraphQL Schema

With a Mnesia database at our disposal, we next create a GraphQL
schema definition. This file describes the contract between the client
system and the server system. It is used by the GraphQL system to know
which queries are valid and which aren't.

In accordance with OTP design principles, we place this schema inside
a projects `priv` directory. Our GraphQL system can then refer to the
private directory of the application in order to load this schema when
the system boots up.
