== Transports

GraphQL is a transport-agnostic system. It can be used on top of every
transport you can imagine. This means the GraphQL system must provide
its own way to tell the outside world about errors, since it cannot
rely on the surrounding system to do so.

The interface to GraphQL at its very base needs support for sending
requests and recieving replies. There is relatively little need for
out-of-order requests since queries tend to be large and
all-encompassing.

However, newer parts of GraphQL which is currently being tried out has
support for delayed and streamed responses.footnote:[Through the use
of the `@streamed` and `@defer` directives among other things] Because
of this, GraphQL will need a more powerful transport for those kinds
of features.

The current {project} implementation does not yet support the optional
tags such as `@streamed` and `@defer`. It is planned for a later
version when the basics are down and works in a robust way.

This tutorial implements GraphQL on top of HTTP through the use of the
Cowboy web server by Lo√Øc Hoguin. We currently use cowboy version
{cowboy-version}.

=== Cowboy Handler

To make GraphQL work with Cowboy, we use the application `sw_web`.
This application then uses `sw_core` in order to run the system. One
could imagine adding other applications to the system if you need more
transports. The web application needs a dispatcher in order to run:

[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_app.erl[tags=dispatcher]
----

We could have picked any place to run the GraphQL interface, but this
code uses `/` at the root.

The Cowboy setup is completely out of the box, except that we
manipulate a couple of variables in order to make cowboy play better
with <<graphiql>>. Look at the file `sw_web_app.erl` for the details.

We set up the cowboy handler as a REST handler. Mostly because it is
fairly easy to do and because it automates a large set of things we'd
like to do. Our plan is to use content-negotiation: a web server will
be served an UI for GraphQL by default, but if the a client request
comes in, we will pass that to the GraphQL system.

The `cowboy_rest` model stems from an idea pioneered by Webmachine. We
can depict an HTTP request as a flow chart where each decision point
is a node in the chart. Since every request follow this flow chart, it
makes sense to use a classic Erlang model: write the generic/general
parts inside a main module `cowboy_rest`, and then provide it with a
callback module. Whenever a decision node is reached, the callback
will be executed and the decision will follow the choice made by the
callback. If no callback function is present, we use a default
resolution.

==== Handler code

The handler starts by declaring the callbacks it has. Each of these
will described in the following sections for those who are not
familiar with `cowboy_rest`:

[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=exports]
----

==== Initialization & REST handling

In this section we describe how the cowboy handler is used to dispatch
a request to GraphQL. We first focus on using `cowboy_rest` to handle
the request basics so we have an easier job later on.

.init/3
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=init]
----

When cowboy dispatches to the `sw_web_graphql_handler` module, this
function is called upon initialization.

We use the _upgrade_ feature of cowboy to upgrade to the `cowboy_rest`
protocol for the remainder of the module. This means `cowboy_rest`
takes over operation and we provide callbacks to the general restful
handler for the parts we want to override.

The first thing `cowboy_rest` will do is to call the next function:

.rest_init/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=rest_init]
----

The purpose of this function is to initialize a state with relevant
information. We are passed data from the dispatcher which we store in
an Erlang map so we can refer to the information later.

.allowed_methods/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=allowed_methods]
----

This callback is used by Cowboy to figure out what the valid methods
are for this particular call. We allow *GET* and *POST* and reject any
other method, since we just want to use REST as a simple transport and
not as a full-blown system. Later we will show why we allow both.

.content_types_accepted/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=content_types_accepted]
----

What types of input we accept. The only way to execute a GraphQL query
is to provide the query embedded in a JSON document. This is currently
the way the GraphiQL tools expects its input.


.content_types_provided/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=content_types_provided]
----

The media types we can provide to a client:

* If the client requests `text/html` we will call the `to_html`
  function.
* If the client requests `application/json` we will call the `to_json`
  function.

This allows us to handle the content different depending on who is
requesting. The browser will by default ask for `text/html` which we
use to feed it a page containing <<graphiql>>. Once the GraphiQL
system is loaded into the browser, it will execute GraphQL queries by
means of setting the desired content type to `application/json`.

.charsets_provided/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=charsets_provided]
----

We only provide UTF-8. By doing so, we can simplify our backend a bit
because it doesn't have to reencode data as long as all the data we
store are in proper UTF-8 encoding. A more advanced system would
analyze the desired content type from the client and eventually
restructure its documents to fit this desired content type. For
simplicity, we omit this part.

.resource_exists/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=resource_exists]
----

In `cowboy_rest`, the call here determines if the resource we
requested exists. Suppose, for instance, that we issue a GET request
and the resource doesn't exist. This will make cowboy return a 404 or
410 status code for the given resource. On the other hand, a POST will
use this to drive its construction of a new object in a RESTful
manner.

We need to wrangle the cowboy system a bit here. We simply call that
for any GET request, the resource exists, and for any POST request
there is a new resource we can create.

==== Processing

We now turn our attention to the actual processing of the GraphQL
query. The first case is when the client requests `text/html` in which
case we just feed data from our static part of the site:

.to_html/2
[source,erlang]
----
include::{sw_web}/src/sw_web_graphql_handler.erl[tags=resource_exists]
----

Actual query processing is a bit more involved. Here is an overview of
what we need to do:

* Gather parameters. The system allows several ways of entering
  parameters, either as part of the URL, or as part of an input
  document.
* Split the parameters into the _query_, the _operation name_, and the
  _parameters_ for the operation.
* Parse, type check and validate the query
* Create an initial context
* Create an initial object for the cursor to point to
* Execute the query will all of the above
* Format a proper response to the client
