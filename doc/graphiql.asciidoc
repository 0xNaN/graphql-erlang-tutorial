== GraphiQL

The ubiquituous front-end for GraphQL servers is a system called
GraphiQL, https://github.com/graphql/graphiql, which provides a nice
user interface for a GraphQL server. We use this system as the
front-end in the demo, whereas real applications will of course skip
this front-end and just call directly to the GraphQL backend.

Having a nice UI for a GraphQL server helps tremendously in
development however. The UI uses the _introspection_ features of
GraphQL which is built into <<project>>. It can thus request the
schema types from the server and use that information to present a
nice user interface.

We have already provided cowboy dispatchers for GraphiQL (see
<<cowboy-handler>>). The only thing we have to do is to build a
minified version of GraphiQL and place it in our `site/assets` folder
inside our `priv` directory in the application `sw_web`. We also
provide a default `index.html` to load when the root URL `/` is
requested.
